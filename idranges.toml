# ==== Configuration for vocabularies ====

# == EnvThes ==

# The name of the vocabulary is used as section name.
# It should match the filename-stem of the vocabulary files.
# [vocabs.envthes]
# Length of integer IDs in vocabulary. IDs will be left-padded with zeros to specified length.
# id_length = 7
# permanent part of IRIs defined in the vocabulary
# permanent_iri_part = "https://vocabs.lter-europe.net/envthes/" # may be to be changed with new URI of EnvThes!

# Section to configure checks (useful in CI pipeline)
# [vocabs.envthes.checks]
# Deleting allowed (relevant in CI-pipeline)
# allow_delete = false

# [vocabs.envthes.prefix_map]
# et = "https://vocabs.lter-europe.net/" # may be to be changed with new URI of EnvThes!

# Section of IDranges for coordinating the allocation of numeric ID ranges to
# contributors for each vocabulary. Each idrange contains the same keys:
#
# first_id = <int>            - first reserved integer ID in idrange
# last_id = <int>             - last reserved integer ID in idrange
# gh_name = "<string>"        - user or organisation name on github
# orcid = "<string> or <url>" - contributor's ORCID, e.g. "0000-0002-1825-0097" or "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097"
# ror_id = "<url>"            - ROR identifier of home organisation, e.g. "https://ror.org/04fa4r544"

# first_id = 1
# last_id = 10
# gh_name = "oggioniale"

# Continue with as many [[vocabs.vocab_example.idrange]] sections as needed.

# More vocabularies can be configured by adding sections with appropriate name.
